# YoctoCooker

This small Python demo software implements a temperature monitor for slow cooking. 

Measures are made using a [Yocto-Pt100](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-environmental-sensors/yocto-pt100) and displayed on on a [Yocto-Display](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-displays/yocto-maxidisplay-g). Simultaneously, they are sent to [Yocto-Visualization (for Web)](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/article/new-yocto-visualization-for-web) by the [YoctoHub-Wireless-n](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/extensions-and-networking/yoctohub-wireless-n) itself for remote monitoring. This example shows how to use an infinite rotary knob, connected directly to the Yocto-MaxiDisplay-G, to add a configuration menu directly on the device.
